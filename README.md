# Use-case-Project
This project documents a use case for an insurance plan feature selection system. It defines user interactions, business rules, and system responses for selecting terms and optional coverages. It highlights my skills in requirements gathering, process modeling, and clear business analysis documentation.
Overview:
This project models a use case for XYZ Insurance, where a registered member selects plan features such as term length and optional coverages. The system dynamically displays available options and calculates costs based on user inputs and business rules.

Key Contributions

-Designed a detailed use case document capturing:

-Actor: Registered insurance member

-Triggers, preconditions, and postconditions

-Primary flow for successful plan selection

-Alternate and exception flows (adding/removing coverages, incomplete fields, age restrictions)

-Defined business rules for term eligibility based on userâ€™s age.

-Mapped system responses to user actions, ensuring clarity between front-end behavior and back-end validations.

-Included coverage amount options (Appendix A) for both 10- and 20-year terms.

-Skills Demonstrated

-Requirements gathering & documentation

-Use case modeling & structured scenarios

-Business rule analysis

-Clear stakeholder communication through structured flows

Outcome:
The final use case provides a comprehensive framework for developers and testers to implement and validate the insurance plan feature selection process, ensuring consistent user experience and business compliance.
